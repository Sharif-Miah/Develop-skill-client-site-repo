# React Router Dom
 <li>React Router Dom is used to build single-page applications i.e. applications that have many pages or components but the page is never refreshed instead the content is dynamically fetched based on the URL. This process is called Routing and it is made possible with the help of React Router Dom.</li>

# Tailwind CSS
 <li>Tailwind CSS makes it quicker to write and maintain the code of your application. By using this utility-first framework, you don't have to write custom CSS to style your application. Instead, you can use utility classes to control the padding, margin, color, font, shadow, and more of your application</li>

#  React-icons
 <li>React-icons is a small library that helps you add icons (from all different icon libraries) to your React apps. It delivers the icons to your app as components so they're easier to work with, and it lets you style them so they're consistent with the overall style of your app.</li>

# React Hot Toast

 <li>React Hot Toast is a library that aims to include toast notifications in your React applications easily and intuitively. It's a three-step process to add the simplest of all notifications in your app. But before we even start doing anything with it, we need to take a look at some of the features it has to offer.</li>

# Private Routes React 

 <li>Private Routes in React Router (also called Protected Routes) require a user being authorized to visit a route (read: page). So if a user is not authorized for a specific page, they cannot access it. The most common example is authentication in a React application where a user can only access the protected pages when they are authorized (which means in this case being authenticated). Authorization goes beyond authentication though. For example, a user can also have roles and permissions which give a user access to specific areas of the application.</li>
